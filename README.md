# VLSI_Lab2
For this lab, I created an ALU of a 16 bit RISC microprocessor in Verilog (Problem 1) and a 10 instruction processor (Problem 2). For Problem 2, there are 3 
versions of the processor: 

processor.v - reads the value 6, stores it at memory location zero, computes the two's complement representation of -6. Then this value is stored in memory location one.
processor1.v - a list of 11 numbers ae stored in memory location 0 to 11. I made a program to reverse the list of numbers by storing the content of memory 11 in memory 0,
the content of memory 10 in memory 1, and so forth.
processor2.v - I wrote a code to evaluate C = A + A * 2^B, where A is 2 and B is 1.
